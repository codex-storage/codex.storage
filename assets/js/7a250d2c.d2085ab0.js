For instance, a storage system with durability of eleven nines (99.999999999%) means there's a very tiny chance (0.0000000001%) of losing data. In simple terms, you might lose only one file out of a million over ten million years. Data Durability is crucial because losing even a little data can be a big problem.

So, if a piece is lost or damaged, the other pieces can be used to recreate the original data.

On Codex, this involves splitting data into pieces, known as "shards," along with extra "parity shards" for backup. These parity shards are created using mathematical formulas based on the original data, helping to rebuild the data if some shards go missing or get damaged. This method lets Codex offer consistent and reliable data storage, meaning that as long as a certain number of shards (N out of M) are safe, the entire original data can be perfectly restored, ensuring a high level of data safety.'})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(r.AccordionItem,{title:"What is Lazy Repair in the context of Codex?",children:(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Lazy Repair is a method in distributed storage systems for managing data issues. In Codex, if a piece of data (a shard) is lost or damaged, the system doesn't fix it right away. It waits until there's enough damage to make repair worthwhile. This is efficient because it saves resources by not addressing small problems that don't harm the overall data.
